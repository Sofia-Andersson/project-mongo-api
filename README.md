# Project Mongo API [View Live &#10555;](https://project-mongo-api-ircjrh2jfq-lz.a.run.app/)

In this project I have created an API with endpoints using mongoose to model data, stored in MongoDB.

## The problem

I created the API by using a dataset found in kaggle.com, (converted from csv to json through csvjson.com).
I have also added a simple frontend starting page displays available routes.

If I had more time I would create more alterative endpoints and queries.

# TECH used:
- MongoDB
- mongoose
- Postman
